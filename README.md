# Java Projects Collection

Welcome to my Java Projects repository! This collection documents my journey of learning and mastering Java programming. It includes a variety of projects, ranging from simple command-line applications to more complex software.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to apply theoretical knowledge to practical, hands-on projects. It serves as a personal portfolio to track my progress, showcase my skills, and solidify my understanding of Java and software development principles.

## Projects

Below is a list of the projects currently in this repository. Each project is contained within its own directory.

| Project Name      | Description                                     | Key Concepts Practiced                      |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **WordRiddleGame** | A simple, interactive riddle game on the console. | `Scanner`, `Control Flow`, `Arrays`, `Loops`|
| *(New project incoming)* | *(description incoming)* | *( future concepts )* |


## How to Run

Each project is self-contained in its own folder. To run a specific project:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/java-projects.git](https://github.com/your-username/java-projects.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate into the project's directory:
    ```sh
    cd java-projects/<project-folder-name>
    ```
3.  Compile and run the main Java file. For example, for the `RiddleGame`:
    ```sh
    javac RiddleGame.java
    java RiddleGame
    ```
**Note:** Some projects may use build tools like Gradle or Maven. Please refer to the specific `README.md` inside the project folder for detailed instructions.

## Future Goals

I plan to continuously add new projects to this repository, exploring more advanced topics such as:
-   Object-Oriented Design Principles
-   Data Structures and Algorithms
-   GUI applications with JavaFX or Swing
-   Web applications with Spring Boot
-   Database connectivity with JDBC
